    <h1>My top three boxers</h1>
    
    <h2>Boxer #2: Terence "Bud" Crawford</h2>

    <p>Crawford gets second place in my book because he fought the man they call, "The Big Fish," Errol "The Truth" Spence. 
        The fight was told to be fighto of the year was was a far cry from what was witnessed when the two fought, Crawford 
        and Spence have been wanting to fight for more than five years but promotional companies did not allow it. When 
        the time came Crawford outclassed, battered, and Spence's corner waved it off as they did not want their fighter 
        to recieve anymore punishment. Thus crowning Crawford the new undisputed champion of the Welterweight division.</p>

    <p>Crawford was also undisputed at Jr. Welterweight(140lbs) before climbing the Welterweight ranks as many feared him 
        for what he did in his previous division. Only adding more reason as to why he should be second in the 
        pound-for-pound rankings.</p>
    
    <p>On another note, Crawford had a rematch clause in the signed contract with Spence, since Spence lost the match he 
        activated the rematch clause for him to fight him next. The thing is one of the belt organizations, the IBF 
        organization did not care and stripped Crawford of said belt. I do feel this is unfair, as he could not fight his 
        mandatory as he had an obligation and the IBF just needed to wait one more fight for Crawford to fight his mandatory.</p>
