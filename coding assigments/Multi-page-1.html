    <h1>My Top Three Boxers</h1>
    
    <h2>Boxer #1: Naoyo "The Monster" Inoue</h2>

    <!--My reasoning as to why Inoue is the pound-for-pound king.-->

    <p>I believe Inoue holds the title for pound-for-pound king due to the fact he is the second man to become undisputed in two Weight-divisions the 
        four belt era and has been knocking out many great fighters in the lower weight classes since the beginning of his career all the way 
        in light flyweight(108lbs) back in 2012. Inoue currently fights at Jr. Featherweight(122lbs) where he holds all four belts, only recently 
        having become undisputed again in 2023 after having knocked out Marlon Tapales who held the other two belts.</p>

    <p>Inoue has the resume to back up his pound-for-pound status, knocked out Paul Butler in December 2022 to become undisputed in Bantamweight(118lbs)
        he then called out the top guy and chose to fight Jr. Featherweight unified champion #1 in the weight-division, Stephen Fulton. He got knocked 
        out, to which Tapales would then walk in the ring to call for the two to fight for undisputed.</p>
