    <h1>My Top Three Boxers</h1>
    
    <h2>Boxer #3: Jesse "Bam" Rodriguez</h2>

    <p>Jesse gets third for what he has done with the lower Weight-divisions and that is shining a light on them with their boxing. 
        Jesse's real breakthrough was his fight with former world champion Carlos Cuadras for the vacant WBC belt, in his fight 
        with Cuadras he dropped and beat. Mind you, Cuadras has never been dropped and on fight night Jesse shocked the world with 
        his power at Super Flyweight(115). What no one was expected was that right after Cuadras he would knockout hard-hitting, 
        granite chin, former unified world champion Srisaket Sor Rungvisai.</p>

    <p>After he would drop down to Flyweight(112lbs) to fight title contender Cristian Gonzalez for the vacant WBO title, a hard 
        fight for Jesse, but he would soon after call out Sunny Edwards and they would fight to unify their respected belts in 
        December 2023. Edward's corner would halt the fight after round eight, right before the start of round nine, thus 
        Jesse is now the unified Flyweight champion for the WBO and IBF belts. </p>
